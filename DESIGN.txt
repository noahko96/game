For my game, I decided to create a 2D scroller.
It will be called "Mafia Mayhem". It will feature a lone vigilante who has taken it upon himself to take down the
mafia. He will take to the city's streets where he will take down thugs and enforcers while working his way up to the
don.
The ultimate goal of the game is to take down the don in the boss level. To advance to the boss level, you will have 
maneuver the dangerous New York City streets filled with obstacles like trash cans, fire escapes, and stray dogs while 
dodging gunfire from the thugs and enforcers who you will have to shoot back at or find a way around. There will be 
some sort of life system, probably something like 3 hits and you are dead, but I will decide on the exact total 
depending on the difficulty I have while testing it. You will be able to pick up helpful powerups including 
bulletproof vests and more powerful guns at weapons caches the vigilante keeps around the city. You will do this until 
you reach the checkpoint which will allow you to advance to the next level. On the boss level, when you are facing the 
don, the only way to reach the checkpoint is to take him down, but he will be much tougher than his minions.
You will use the arrows to move your character. It will be the standard ones as well, like right arrow for forward, 
left for back, and up for jump. Then, you can use the spacebar to shoot.
