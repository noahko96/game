###Data or Resource Files Required by the Project

*All of the pictures in the images folder
*I am not sure but when I was implementing my font for my menus, it looked like you could only use fonts already on 
 your computer. Since I have Microsoft Word on my computer, I think I had access to a lot of fonts and I used 
 Chiller. If the words are not coming up for my menus, that might be the issue.

###My Impressions of the Assignment

*I thought it was a fun little assignment to start the semester but it would have been better if we could have learned
 a bit more about JavaFx first because I spent a lot of time just figuring out what I could do with it.
